## Sample of Excel Sheets Generated for Status Checks at Work, Evaluation Reports, Communicate Technical Needs, and Process Diagrams

Since I first learned Excel, I have been a huge fan! The documents in this section display some of my skills in Excel.

### What You Will See

1. Collaborative Grant Student Demographics: This shows the student demographics of a grant-funded program. I lead the grant administration, supervision, and data. There are 4 partners who work together on this grant in different locations. The grant began in 2017 and has been recently funded again through 2027 for $950,000 per year. This is stacked bar charts.
2. Grant Transition Planning and Data Tracking: Over the course of 2 years, we lost 9 of a 23 person team, and did not rehire anyone. The remaining staff were expected to maintain the grant contact hour requirements and I as leadership had to help folks transition and manage their workloads throughout the process, and maintain the grant's data requirements. This document was used to track actual vs. expected data entered as a team and by individual, to show why the data entry was lower than expected, and how that would be rectified for the following year.
3. Fund Distribution Flow Process Map: One major component of our program's success is emergency funding. We have multiple sources of emergency funding and the processes are different for each funding source.
4. Sample Graphs for New Org: I used this sheet to communicate with the database team what new graphs I would like to have added to our database dashboard. This document shows I communicate with technical teams.
5. STEM Semantics Survey Evaluation: This was a spreadsheet that I used to analyze survey data on a STEM program evaluation project. Each tab shows a different topic of the evaluation. Most of the graphs are grouped bar charts.
6. Program Evaluation Report: Actionable program evaluation report that compares the impact of two programs.
7. Display of Excel Skills: This was an exam for my data analytics class. Unfortunately, the question prompts are not included, but these sheets display a wide range of my skills in Excel with formulas.

### Learning Process
I love Excel. I remember the day that I know I was an Excel nerd. I was working with a colleague on a project and he came running down the hall urgently looking for me. He had just learned that pressing option and return allows you to return within a cell. This was 2006. Since then, I have been known in my community as an Excel expert, and I have continued to learn more about the amazing capabilities of Excel. I also felt the same level of excitement when I learned how to use pivot tables! Wow, they make life so much easier!

Currently, I am exploring the Data Analyst add-on to work through some statistical operations on college student transcript data. We are exploring the length of time it takes to complete a degree and the number of schools a student attends. The population is youth who use homeless vs. DCF vs. no tuition exemptions in South Florida.
